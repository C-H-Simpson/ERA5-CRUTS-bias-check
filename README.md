# Comparing ERA5 and CRU-TS

Someone sent a plot suggesting that ERA5 has a $>2^oC$ average cold bias with respect to observations, in coastal cells in May and August. CRU-TS appeared to match observations much better (CRU-TS is gridded data that interpolated a set of observations).

The data have already been aggregated by month, using `Agg_ERA5_and_CRUTS.py`.
You can download the data from my server, that I have already aggregated, using `data/get_aggregated_data.sh` (about 150 MB).

The analysis is in `ERA5_vs_CRUTS.ipynb`.
